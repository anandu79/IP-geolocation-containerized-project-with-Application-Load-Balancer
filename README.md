# IP-geolocation-containerized-project-with-Application-Load-Balancer

Here, I have created a program which provides us with the geolocation of an IP address using docker containers.

![docker](https://github.com/anandu79/IP-geolocation-containerized-project-with-Application-Load-Balancer/blob/main/images/docker.jpg?raw=true)

For that, we have to launch 3 Ammazon Linux EC2 instances.
I have changed their names to api-service-instance1, api-service-instance2, and api-caching-instance1 for better understanding.

We can change the hostname using:

```
hostnamectl set-hostname api-service-instance1
hostnamectl set-hostname api-service-instance2
hostnamectl set-hostname api-caching-instance1
```

Install docker in all 3 servers using the below command:

```
yum install docker -y
```

Enable docker service:

```
systemctl enable docker.service
```

## Docker container creation in api-caching-instance1

SSH into api-caching-instance and create a docker container using [redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis).

> Redis is an open source key-value store that functions as a data structure server.

You can use the below command to create the container:

```
docker container run --name redis -d --restart always -p 6379:6379 redis:latest
```

Use the below command to list the containers created in the server:

```
docker container ls -a
```

Output:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                       NAMES
931794dc2c3a   redis:latest   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   3 minutes ago   Up 3 minutes   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp, :::6379->6379/tcp   redis
```

## Container creation in api-service-instance1

Now that we have created redis container in api-caching-instance, we have to create 2 docker containers api-service-1 and api-service-2 in api-service-instance1. For that, SSH into the instance and use the below command:

```
docker container run \ 
-d \ 
-p 8081:8080 \ 
--name api-service1 \ 
--restart always \ 
-e REDIS_PORT="6379" \ 
-e REDIS_HOST="private IP address of ap-caching-instance1" \ 
-e APP_PORT="8080" \ 
-e API_KEY="your API key from https://app.ipgeolocation.io/" \ 
fujikomalan/ipgeolocation-api-service:latest
```

***In REDIS_HOST we will have to add the private IP address of the api-caching-instance1. If the server reboots, the IP address will change and we will have to edit the code again. In order to resolve this, we will create a private hosted zone instead and create a zone that points to the private IP address of api-caching-intsnace1. Or else we can create a Redis cluster in Elasticache and point it to the private hosted zone.***

Here I am creating a Redis cluster in Elasticache, for that do the following.

Go to ElastiCache dashboard in your AWS > Create cluster > and select "Create Redis cluster"

1. In **Cluster mode**, select Disabled.

2. In **Cluster info**, provide name and a discription(optional)

3. In **Location** we can choose whether to host the cluster in the AWS Cloud or on premises. I am selecting **AWS Cloud** here. Multi-AZ should be enabled.

4. In **Cluster settings**, change the Node type to "cache.t2.micro". Number of replicas should be 2. 

5. In **Subnet group settings**, select "Choose existing subnet group".

6. Select "Specify Availability Zones" in **Availability Zone placements**, and select the regions and replicas as per your requirement.

7. Click on Next.

8. In Advanced settings, Enable "Encryption at rest" under the **Security** section. Encryption key should be set as default. Select a security group too.

9. Backup, Maintenance, and Logs sections are optional, configure if required.

10. Give an appropriate Tag and click on Next. Then review the settings and click on **Create**.

> *Please note that it will take some time to complete the creation of the redis cluster.*
